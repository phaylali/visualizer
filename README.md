# **Omniversify Keystroke Visualizer ‚å®Ô∏èüñ±Ô∏è‚ú®**

A simple, modern, and highly configurable open-source tool to display your keystrokes and mouse actions on screen. Perfect for creating tutorials, live streaming, presentations, or just making your screencasts look more professional\! üöÄ

Created during an episode of the **\#MGDB (Moroccan Game Developer Blog)**, this tool is built with flexibility in mind.

### **üåü Features**

* **Keyboard, Click & Scroll Display:** Visualizes every input, including keyboard keys, mouse clicks (LMB, RMB, MMB), and scroll wheel actions (‚ñ≤/‚ñº).  
* **Highly Customizable:** Control the look, feel, and position of the overlay using a simple config.ini file. No code editing required\!  
* **Custom Fonts & Colors:** Easily change the font, size, color, and background to match your brand or desktop theme.  
* **Flexible Positioning:** Place the overlay anywhere on your screen: top, bottom, center, or any of the corners, with fine-tuned pixel offsets.  
* **Lightweight & Cross-Platform:** Built with Python and standard libraries, making it efficient and easy to run on most Linux distributions.

### **üöÄ Setup & Installation**

Getting the visualizer up and running is easy. Just follow these three steps.

#### **1\. Get the Files**

First, clone this repository or download the files to a directory on your computer.

git clone \<your-repo-url-here\>  
cd omniversify-keystroke-visualizer

You should have two main files in your directory:

* visualizer.py (The main application)  
* config.ini (The configuration file)

#### **2\. Install Dependencies**

This tool requires Python 3 and a few libraries.

a) Install pip and tkinter:  
These packages are often required on Linux systems.

* **On Debian/Ubuntu:**  
  sudo apt update  
  sudo apt install python3-pip python3-tk

* **On Fedora:**  
  sudo dnf install python3-pip python3-tkinter

* **On Arch Linux:**  
  sudo pacman \-Syu python-pip tk

b) Install pynput:  
This is the Python library used to listen for keyboard and mouse input.  
pip install pynput

#### **3\. Run the Application**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the visualizer from your terminal:

python visualizer.py

The application will start running in the background. To stop it, simply press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (config.ini)**

The magic of this tool lies in the config.ini file. Open it with any text editor to change how the visualizer looks and behaves.
